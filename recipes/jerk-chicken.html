    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>Thyme</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
        <li>Seasonings (garlic powder, onion powder, kosher salt, and freshly ground black pepper)</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol> 
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare Ahead: </strong>The spice mixture can be prepared days ahead of time. 
            Cinnamon, ginger, cloves, sugar, thyme, cayenne, allspice, onion, garlic, 
            and smoked paprika can all be combined in advance.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Dry and Poke: </strong> Thoroughly dry chicken pieces with clean paper towels 
            and use a fork to poke holes throughout all the pieces.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Season: </strong>Rub all that aromatic goodness <strong>onto and under the chicken skin</strong>. 
            That's always my secret to well-seasoned poultry: get that rub under the skin - wear gloves 
            if you'd like, but absolutely work the seasonings on top and underneath the skin throughout.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bake: </strong> Place chicken on large rimmed/foil-lined baking sheet, with 
            space in between each piece. For smaller-sized chicken legs, bake about 40 minutes; 
            for larger-sized chicken legs, bake about 50 minutes or until nicely browned.
        </li>
    </ol>
